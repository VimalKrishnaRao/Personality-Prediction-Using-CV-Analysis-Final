## Personality Prediction Using CV Analysis -  README

This project is a web application that utilizes AI to predict personality traits based on the information extracted from uploaded Curriculum Vitae (CVs). The backend is implemented using Python Flask and SQLite3 for data storage.

### Project Highlights

* **User Authentication:** Users can create accounts, log in, and securely access their information.
* **CV Upload and Parsing:** The application allows uploading CVs in various formats and parses relevant information like name, contact details, education, work experience, and skills.
* **AI-powered Personality Prediction:** An AI model analyzes the extracted information and predicts the user's personality traits.
* **Upload History:** Users can view a history of their uploaded CVs.

### Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (likely with a framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js)
* **Backend:** Python Flask for server-side logic and API handling
* **Database:** SQLite3 for storing user accounts and upload history (analysis results may also be stored here depending on implementation)

### Getting Started

This project requires a frontend code setup in addition to the Python Flask backend and SQLite3 database. Here's a general guide to get you started (specific configurations may differ):

**Prerequisites:**

* A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
* Python 3.x installed with required libraries (see below)

**Backend Setup:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cv-analysis-project.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   cd cv-analysis-project
   pip install Flask flask-sqlalchemy sqlite3
   ```

   * Flask: Web framework for building the backend API
   * Flask-SQLAlchemy: Simplifies database interactions with Flask
   * sqlite3: Python library for interacting with SQLite3 databases

3. **Database Schema:**

   The project likely has a Python script that defines the database schema (tables and columns) for user accounts, upload history, and potentially analysis results. Refer to the code (models.py or similar) for details on the database structure.

4. **Configuration:**

   * Update the Flask configuration in the project's main script (usually app.py) to specify the connection details for your SQLite3 database. This typically involves setting the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` environment variable.
   * Configure the Flask routes and logic for handling user registration, login, CV upload processing (including data extraction and storage), interaction with the AI model for personality prediction, and potentially storing analysis results.

**Frontend Setup:**

(refer to the previous instructions assuming you have a separate frontend codebase)

1. **Clone the Repository (if separate):**

   Follow the steps mentioned in the Frontend Setup section of the previous instructions if you have a separate frontend codebase.

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the necessary frontend package manager dependencies (e.g., npm or yarn) as per your chosen framework.

3. **Configuration:**

   Update the frontend code to connect to your backend Flask API endpoints for functionalities like user login, CV upload, retrieving analysis results, and accessing upload history. This typically involves configuring URLs and potentially authentication tokens.
   * Refer to the backend documentation (likely within the Flask application code) for specific API endpoint details and authentication mechanisms.

4. **Start the Development Server:**

   Follow the instructions for your chosen framework to start a development server that serves the frontend application.

**Running the Application:**

1. **Start your web server:**

   Configure your web server to serve the application's static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from the frontend directory (assuming separate frontend code).

2. **Run the Flask Development Server (for development):**

   ```bash
   python app.py  # Replace 'app.py' with your main Flask script name
   ```

   This starts the Flask development server, allowing you to make changes to the backend code and see them reflected without restarting the entire application.

3. **Production Deployment:**

   For production deployment, you'll need a separate process manager like Gunicorn to serve the Flask application. Refer to Flask deployment documentation for recommended practices.

4. **Access the Application:**

   Access the application URL in your web browser.

**Note:** These are general guidelines. The specific setup process may vary depending on your chosen frontend framework and chosen AI model integration approach.  Consult the documentation for Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, your AI model (if applicable), and your chosen frontend framework for detailed instructions.
